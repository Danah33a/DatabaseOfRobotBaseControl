# DatabaseOfRobotBaseControl
`As shown in the file, I created a txt file to show you the code of creating Database for the robot base control. In addtion, i have use SQL Language via Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. 

NOTE: 
When I creat the Database I have use in each column type: "varchar(1)", which means that the enter data will be a letter Ex: F >> forward , S >> Stop , L >> Left, etc... 
and "(1)" >> It means only can handel one letter.
